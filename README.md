## 🧐 What's inside? 📕

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this personal website.

    .
    ├── assets
    ├── node_modules
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── CNAME
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── index.html
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── yarn.lock

  1.  **`/assets`**: The directory where all of the page's assets and images are stored and hosted.
  
  2.  **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.
  
  3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
  
  4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for a tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.
  
  5.  **`CNAME`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.
  
  6.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.
  
  7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
  
  8.  **`index.html`**: This file is where the html content of the front page is stored.
  
  9.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).
  
  10.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` above, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).
  
  11.  **`yarn.lock`**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. You can use either yarn or npm.  This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.
